# MonetizeArt
MonetizeArt is a machine learning project designed to select and train on a limited dataset of 20 Claude Monet paintings to create a model that transforms everyday photos into impressionist art. By carefully curating a subset of Monet's works, the model is trained to replicate the colors, brush strokes, and texture that define his iconic style.
